<h1>Jetblade</h1>
<p>
<h3 align="center">.01 </h3>This is the documentation for the Jetblade project. Jetblade is a 2D platforming <a class="el" href="namespacegame.html" title="This package centralizes access to singletons.">game</a> in the style of the Metroid and Castlevania series, with procedurally-generated maps. At the moment it is still deep in development, and is thus not remotely playable. Jetblade is an open-source project, and your contributions are welcome!<p>
Jetblade is written in Python with PyGame.<p>
Broadly, the project can be broken down into the following categories:<ul>
<li>Large-scale procedural map generation, the creation of a selection of tunnels and their interconnections, the selection of different types of regions, the ensuring of general accessibility, and the creation of specific roadblocks to add meaning to exploration. Important classes for this category are the Map and TreeNode.</li><li>Small-scale procedural map generation, the definition of what a region of the map is like, and the creation of interesting features at the scale of an individual tunnel or room. The TreeNode class is important for this, as are the various dynamically-loaded modules in the data/mapgen directory.</li><li>Platforming gameplay, the implementation of 2D physics in a run&amp;jump context, the addition of abilities to the player, and the creation of new creatures for the player to encounter and possibly battle. Important classes for this category are the PhysicsObject, TerrestrialObject, and Player class, at the moment. You may also want to examine the Blender model files.</li></ul>
<p>
Additionally, for general information on running the program, see the <a class="el" href="namespacejetblade.html" title="This package contains the logic for setting up and running the program.">jetblade</a> package documentation. </div>
